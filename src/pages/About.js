          I'm James Smith, and my primary role on this project was styling using
          Sass. I also created the logic to tie posts to their users and
          assisted in setting up a few React components. If you like this site,
          take a look at my portfolio, and if you think I'd be a good fit at
          your organization, feel free to reach out. Thanks for looking, and
          have a nice day.
